						h2.news-content-title All sail being set, he now cast loose the
							| life-line, reserved.
						p.news-content-sub-title With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as for the better understanding of all similar
							| scenes elsewhere presented, I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.
						div.news-content-body
							p.news-content-body__text Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely
								| superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not so durable
								| as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and I will add (since
								| there is an aesthetics in all things), is much more handsome and becoming
								| to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian; but
								| Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.

								div.news-content-body-image-description Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost
									| entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-line

							p.news-content-body__text The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first sight, you
								| would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment its one and fifty
								| yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds; so
								| that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons. In length,
								| the common sperm whale-line measures something over two hundred
								| fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub,
								| not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round,
								| cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded "sheaves," or layers of concentric
								| spiralizations, without any hollow but the "heart," or minute vertical tube
								| formed at the axis of the cheese.
							p.news-content-body__text Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails set all the
								| paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to leeward; and Ahab
								| heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up Fedallah's sunken eyes; a
								| hideous motion. The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp
								| slightly vapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of
								| ordinary ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more
								| pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient
								| to the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity
								| too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be
								| subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no
								| means adds to the rope's durability or strength, however much it may give
								| it compactness and gloss.
							p.news-content-body__text Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-
								| splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and
								| hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything. This
								| arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order
								| to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat,
								| in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off
								| the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these instances, the
								| whale of courseis shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to
								| the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort.
								| Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common safety's sake.
								| As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take
								| somebody's arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in
								| stowing the line in its tub. Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire
								| morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it
								| downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to
								| free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.
